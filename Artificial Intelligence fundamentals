AIs built to interpret everyday language and act on it in some meaningful way. This is known in the industry as natural language processing, or just NLP.
NLP is a huge part of generative AI, a subcategory of AI that takes words and turns them into unique images, sounds, and of course other words.
AI related to language. They were training AI models to perform all sorts of tasks that involved interpreting text. That’s a task that requires an understanding of how words are combined in everyday use, and it’s a great example of what experts call natural language processing (NLP). 
Because there are so many ways to “process” language, NLP describes a broad category of AI. Some AIs that perform NLP are trained on huge amounts of data, which in this case means samples of text written by real people. The internet, with its billion web pages, is a great source of sample data. 
Because these AI models are trained on such massive amounts of data, they’re known as large language models (LLMs). LLMs capture, in incredible detail, the language rules humans take years to learn. LLMs are like a collection of rules for how a language structures words into ideas. Each language has its own rules.
